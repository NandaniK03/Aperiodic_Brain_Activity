# Aperiodic Brain Activity

Neural power spectra of sleep electrophysiological signals consist of two major components: an aperiodic component represented by a 1/f-like slope and a periodic component represented by oscillations appearing as bumps above the 1/f-like slope. Brain activity corresponding to the ‘1/f’ slope has been deemed unimportant for a long time and is often removed from analyses to emphasize brain oscillations. Emerging evidence suggests that aperiodic brain activity contributes actively to brain functioning. An algorithm which models the power spectrum as a combination of an aperiodic component (1/f slope) and a periodic component (peaks over the 1/f slope), called FOOOF (fitting oscillations and one over f) was applied to a set of annotated whole-night sleep EEG recordings of 45 subjects (24 meditating subjects and 21 non-meditating subjects). In this study, extracted aperiodic parameters were analyzed for sleep 
stage sensitivity and brain region interaction. The study also investigates whether aperiodic spectral parameters derived from FOOOF analysis of EEG 
data hold promise as objective measures for characterizing sleep states.
