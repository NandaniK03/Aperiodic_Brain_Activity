# Scale-free Brain Activity

Neural power spectra of sleep electrophysiological signals consist of 
two major components: an aperiodic component represented by a 1/f like slope 
and a periodic component represented by oscillations appearing as bumps above 
the 1/f like slope. Brain activity corresponding to the ‘1/f’ slope has been 
deemed unimportant for a long time and often removed from analyses to em
phasize brain oscillations. Emerging evidence suggests that aperiodic brain ac
tivity contributes actively to brain functioning. An algorithm which models the 
power spectrum as a combination of an aperiodic component (1/f slope) and a 
periodic component (peaks over the 1/f slope), called FOOOF (fitting oscilla
tions and one over f) was applied to a set of annotated whole-night sleep EEG 
recordings of 45 subjects (24 meditating subjects and 21 non-meditating sub
jects). In this study, extracted aperiodic parameters were analyzed for sleep 
stage sensitivity as well as brain region interaction. The study also investigates 
whether aperiodic spectral parameters derived from FOOOF analysis of EEG 
data hold promise as objective measures for characterizing sleep states.
